Collecting data on measles cases was motivated by:
http://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/ which (for
measles) is curiously missing about half the states, and stops in
2012. For more about the vaccine: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles_vaccine

Measles case data:

From 1930 to 2000: The Tycho project at U Pittsburgh: http://www.tycho.pitt.edu
offers "Level 2 data": http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/data/level2.php which
was post-processed to sum over weeks within year.

From 2001 through 2014, the CDC's annual "Summary of Notifiable
Diseases" summarizes data that year's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Reports (MMWRs) They are at: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_nd/

For 2015 and 2016, the CNC's (National Notifiable Diseases
Surveillance System) NNDSS tables provide comparable information:

2015: https://data.cdc.gov/NNDSS/NNDSS-Table-I-infrequently-reported-notifiable-dis/pb4z-432k
2016: https://data.cdc.gov/NNDSS/NNDSS-Table-I-infrequently-reported-notifiable-dis/dwqk-w36f

However, the numbers seem to be smaller than than those in the MMWRs,
at least for 2014 (where we compared NNDSS and MMWR numbers). This
is perhaps explained by by a note on the NNDSS pages: "These are
provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases ... . NDSS
data reported by the 50 states ...  are collated and published weekly
as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality
Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to
CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision
of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in these tables are
presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore,
numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these
counts as additional information becomes available."

Measles data was collated by GLK and the TAs, and post-processed by GLK.

US State population data came from http://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/181605
in particular the state2010_hist_pops.xlsx from which the s2010_hist_pops
table was extracted, and from which the decades 1930 to 2010 were selected.

Population data was downloaded and post-processed by GLK.
