## GOOD VIS

Enabling the bar graph's property of showing exact length, we are shown exactly
the degree to which each body part is affected and for how long.

For the good visualization, I followed the principle of proximity and
similarity. Proximity on the graph shows that the relationship between the
percentage and the recovery time are related, and similarity shows the
comparison among body parts.

The body parts were by horizontal tick annotation. I encoded the bars of the
bar graph: green for percentage and blue for recovery time. They are laid out
vertically.

The vertical scales are aligned to the maximum number of recovery days and
percentage, so the viewer can see the outlier body parts and be able to make
more accurate assessments of the values.

## BAD VIS

I wanted to enable the pie charts problem of only being able to guess what
percentage of the pie belongs to each body part. And wanted to use opacity's
problem of only being able roughly estimate the extent to which the pie slices
are darkened (recovery days).

I wanted to hamper the principle of proximity and similarity. You would know
that two parts are next to each other using the legend, but looking would be
difficult because all the colors are black and none of the pies are labelled.
Similarity is also hampered because you can't really compare one slice of the
pie with the others.

The body parts were by annotation in the legend of the pie chart. I encoded the
percentage into the dimensions of each pie slice and encoded the recovery days
into the opacity of the color black in each pie slice.

The viewer mostly will not be able to read the number of recovery days, they
would have to estimate the amount of days needed. Also the pie chart would
make it difficult to know which slice belongs to which body part.
