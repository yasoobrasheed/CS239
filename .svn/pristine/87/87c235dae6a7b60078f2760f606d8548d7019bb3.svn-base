Numeric grade components are indicated as a fraction E/T, where E is what you
earned, and T is the points possible. The final sum (written and coding work)
at the top of the file is another fraction; the denominator does not determine
the contribution of this assignment to the final grade.

Requests for reconsideration of a grade should be made within a week by
posting a private note in the hw5 Piazza folder.  Structure your note as:
- Your CNetID
- Which part you think was mis-graded
- Who graded it
- Your explanation
Not conforming to this structure will slow down regrading.
