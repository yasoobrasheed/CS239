Numeric grade components are indicated as a fraction E/T, where E is what you
earned, and T is the points possible. The final sum (written and coding work)
at the top of the file is another fraction; the denominator does not determine
the contribution of this assignment to the final grade.  Correct answers were
given out in class on April 12. Explanatory notes for deductions may be above.

Requests for reconsideration of a grade should be made within a week by
posting a private note in the hw2 Piazza folder.  **STATE** **YOUR**
**CNETID**, the question you think was mis-graded, and your explanation.
