1) Concerning [Stevens-Scales-1946]: State how Stevens would identify the scale
(nominal aka categorical, ordinal, interval, and ratio) for each of the
following variables.  Some may have more than one correct answer.  A terse
justification (20 words or less) is allowed, but not needed.

a) degrees Celsius
b) Mohs scale of mineral hardness
c) a quantity X for which log(X) is well-defined
d) the number of students in datavis18
e) rankings of CS departments in different colleges
f) Gregorian calendar dates
g) intelligence
h) baby names
i) a variable V for which using V2 instead of V makes no practical difference
j) the price of Facebook's (FB) stock on the NASDAQ exchange

What is i? Should we put the correct answer?
a. Interval value, can measure it but value of 0 does not mean no temperature.
b. Ordinal value, order preserving but underlying values are not measured.
c. Interval value, can measure it but value of 0 does not exist.
d. Ratio value, can measure it and value of 0 means no students in the class.
e. Ordinal value, order preserving but underlying values can be arbitrary.
f. Interval value, can measure it but value of 0 does not mean no date.
g. Ordinal value, can measure it but underlying values are more than rank-order.
h. Nominal value, unique words, assignment.
i.
j. Ratio value, can measure it and value of 0 means no price.

2) Concerning the Lie Factor in [Tufte-GraphicalIntegrity-2001]:
a) Suppose x1 and x2 are two values of some (ratio) variable V to be visualized,
and that p(x1) and p(x2) are either the magnitudes of the physical encoding of
variable V or the magnitudes of the perception of the encoding (Tufte seems to
conflate these when it comes to Lie Factor). Suppose also that x1 is not zero,
and nor is p(x1).  Give the complete formula for the Lie Factor of the encoding
in question, in terms of x1, x2, p(x1), and p(x2).  No prose explanation needed.
b) Find and identify a visualization online with a significant Lie Factor (less
than 0.9 or more than 1.1), and compute the Lie Factor, using approximate screen
area in pixels as the physical measure of the magnitude of the visual encoding.
Remember the possible sources of visualizations from hw1. It is okay for 
multiple people to end up submitting the same visualization. Show your work.
You can simplify your task by identifying just two elements in the
visualization, and the change between them, as the thing for which you compute a
Lie Factor (one visualization could have more than one Lie Factor depending on
two data elements are scrutinized).
