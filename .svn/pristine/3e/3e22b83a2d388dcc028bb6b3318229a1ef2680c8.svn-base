1)

a. Interval value, can measure it but value of 0 does not mean no temperature.
b. Ordinal value, order preserving but underlying values are not measured.
c. Ratio value, log(x) - log(y) = log(x / y)
d. Ratio value, can measure it and value of 0 means no students in the class.
e. Ordinal value, order preserving but underlying values can be arbitrary.
f. Interval value, can measure it but value of 0 does not mean no date.
g. Ordinal value, can measure it but underlying values are more than rank-order.
h. Nominal value, unique words, assignment.

   Data Visualization: "Net Sales" (under "A Retail Colossus" section)

   Will scrutinize the change in net sales from 2015 to 2017

   2017: 115 billion - 112 px
   2015: 75 billion - 64 px

   p = (115 - 75) / 75 * 100 = 53.333
   q = (112 - 64) / 64 * 100 = 75

   Lie Factor = q / p = 1.406
