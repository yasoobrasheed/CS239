yasoobr hw3 grade: 110/148
Graded revision 16

**************** Questions #1 and #2 were stated on Piazza (no coding)

You handed in a file called "hw3.pdf" but it was actually just a plain
text file, not a PDF file.  We asked that you submit a PDF file.  We
use PDF because it can represent the formatting that many people chose
to use, and it is easy to convert/print anything to PDF.  Not using
PDF slows down grading.  Please submit PDF files.

#1.a = 0/3  spatial substrate
#1.b = 3/3
#1.c = 0/3  expressive
#1.d = 0/3  effective
#1.e = 3/3
#1.f = 3/3
#1.g = 3/3
#1.h = 3/3

#2.a = 3/3
#2.b = 3/3
#2.c = 0/3  actually zero people; not studied experimentally
#2.d = 0/3  what percent an indicated bar or segment is of the largest
#2.e = 0/3  ~55%
#2.f = 0/3  "TYPE 3" part of Figure 13
#2.g = 3/3
#2.h = 1/3  but didn't answer second part (no, author's experimental results don't bear on how to visualize categorical variables)

**************** Coding portion of hw3

Deduction explanations are in index-graded.js, utils-graded.js

# Modified only appropriate files               = 0/0

***** index.js correctness (67 pts) ===

3 Handed Clock (37 pts)
# Has 3 hands (second/minute/hour)              = 10/10
# Has 12 numerical markings indicating hour     = 5/5
# Hands move                                    = 2/2
# Hands move in a clock like ratio              = 0/15
  (second hand moves 60x the minute, which moves 12x the hour)
# Second hand visits 60 places around the wheel = 5/5

Chromachron (30 pts)
# 12 sections are visually correct              = 15/15
# Wedge dial is visually correct                = 10/10
# Wedge dial moves                              = 5/5

***** utils.js correctness (13 pts) ===

# Tests pass                                    = 13/13

# ***** Style (any file)                        = 20/20

****************************************************************

Numeric grade components are indicated as a fraction E/T, where E is what you
earned, and T is the points possible. The final sum (written and coding work)
at the top of the file is another fraction; the denominator does not determine
the contribution of this assignment to the final grade.  Reference solutions
were given out in class on April 19. Explanatory notes for deductions may be
above.

Requests for reconsideration of a grade should be made within a week by
posting a private note in the hw3 Piazza folder.  Structure your note as:
- Your CNetID
- The question or point you think was mis-graded
- The grader associated with that point
- Your explanation.
Not conforming to this structure will slow down regrading.
