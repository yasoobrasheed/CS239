The plots above (best seen with a fixed-width font) depict the distribution of grades
(in a [0,100] range) for the whole class, with one line per grade component.
The "---" spans from the 5th to the 95th percentile, containing 90% of the class.
The "===" spans from the 25th to the 75th percentile, containing 50% of the class.
The "<m>" marks the median, the grade that splits the grade distribution in half.
Your grade is indicated with a single "X" (which overwrites one character of the
plot, including possibly the "<", "m", or ">" of the median indicator).

These grades were gathered from your per-assignment grades and processed with scripts
created by GLK. This file may not reflect recent corrections to per-assignment grades.
If you believe there is an error in some individual assignment grade, double-
check the per-assignment gradefile. If you think information above does not match
what you think you got on an assignment, or if you believe there is an error in the
arithmetic here, ask (privately) on Piazza.
