This grading scheme is based on what was given in the
Project 1 definition: https://piazza.com/class/jf9pbi0hf8i178?cid=85

****** The Proposal:
# was on-time = 2/2

# described purpose, data source, pre-processing, vis methods = 2/2

# was refined as needed based on feedback = 2/2
didn't have a clear plan at first, but changed direction


****** The Write-up:
# Answers basic questions about context and purpose = 3/5
You discuss two different measures of poverty, but you don't explain how combining
these two particular measures tells us something new.  The questions you state ("in
which regions of the U.S. do people have access to affordable housing with little need of
nutrition assistance?") are essentially restatements of "where does the data take on
certain values".  That's not a real question, in the way we've been talking about
"What's the question?" in this class.  We make visualizations to learn something about
the phenomenon in the real world that generate data or can be measured with data,
not just to looking at the numbers themselves. What would it like to live, for example,
in a place with high ELI housing availability, but low SNAP participation, and how does
that map to a US viewer's sense of geography?

# Documents pre-processing = 3/3

# Documents and defends layout and encoding design decisions = 3/4
You made a bivariate map in LAB space, by putting a parallelepiped along the L and B
axes, but you could have explained more exactly how: what were the two basis vectors in
LAB space that were scaled by each variable?  And how did you choose that? It looks
like you set it up so that varying each variable in isolation would change both
L and B, but could you could oriented it so that one variable was aligned with L
and one with B.

# Describes different vis that could have been made from same data = 3/4
A scatterplot embedded within the colormap legend would actually have been a useful
complement to the poster.  You also could have had smaller inset maps that showed
the individual variation of the two variables in isolation, to help understand the
colormap showing their combined variation.

# Documents division of labor = 2/2


****** The Code:
# had good Javascript style (lint + eyeball), and effective d3 usage = 9/9

# produces result algorithmically (rather than lots of hard-coding) = 3/3


****** The finished poster:
# was able to be printed (e.g. nothing dynamic) = 2/2

# (with write-up) demonstrates understanding and use of class content to date = 3/3
Creating your own bivariate map was ambitious.

# is a self-contained document with title, authors, and explanation = 1/3
The authors are missing from the poster!
The single sentence under the title does not do enough to explain what we might learn from this.
The ELI variable in particular merits more explanation- is it a measure of poverty,
or a mismatch between poverty and housing availability? Besides restating something
about the data, what is the common political or cultural context for all the regions
that are blue, or yellow? 

# shows evidence of thought, care, and intent (rather than defaults) = 3/3

# has salient visible structure, with further details available w/ closer scrutiny = 1/3
It would have helped a lot to have annotations so the viewer has an opportunity to connect what
they might know about geography and poverty (where is Detroit?  Where is the "deep south"?)  You
mentioned omitting the state boundaries, but given how much the data varies over space, it
would have helped to see the states to provide that geographic context.

# is, over-all, an effective visualization = 7/10
One way to understand the notion of Correspondence that Algebraic Vis tries to give mathematical
meaning to, but which came up before when talking about "Effective" visualizations is to ask:
Do the structures that clearly stand out in visualization correspond to important things about
the world, as measured by the data?  What stands out in this map is the blues, and the dense
alternation of blue and dark gray in the south east?  Do you mean Blue to be so prominent?
What explains the sometimes very spatially incoherent variation of SNAP? Because of this
and the issues above, it is hard to leave the poster feeling that one has learned
something new.
