yasoobr hw4 grade: 118/142
Graded revision 29

**************** Questions #1 -- #4 were stated on Piazza (no coding)

#1.a = 2/2
#1.b = 2/2
#1.c = 1/3  there were 3 sub-parts, as noted in question
#1.d = 0/2  True
#1.e = 2/2

#2.a = 6/6
#2.b = 5/5

#3.a = 5/5 (reason 1)  It seems you only gave one reason; two were requested
#3.b = 0/5 (reason 2)

#4.a = 3/5  but genes don't have to be ordered
#4.b = 5/5

**************** Design and Coding portion of hw4
Deductions may be explained here or in *-graded.js:

# Modified only appropriate files           = 10/10
# Used only approved packages               = 5/5
  c.f. https://piazza.com/class/jf9pbi0hf8i178?cid=232
# No dynamic elements                       = 5/5
# Visualized data w/out hardcoding          = 20/20

"Good" vis and write-up:
# says which task(s) the vis enables        = 3/5 you talk around but didn't ever specify which of the numbered tasks (besides #1) you're enabling
# says which two principles the vis follows = 4/4 okay, but I'd say you're mainly using "position along a common axis" (Cleveland + McGill)
# vis works well and writeup says how        = 13/16
position along a common axis is what makes these legible, not "proximity and similarity" (which aren't about quantitative comparisons)
nice job using overlap to thwart the geometric separation of the bars, but it does
interfere somewhat with reading off the recovery times.

"Bad" vis and write-up:
# says which task(s) the vis hampers        = 3/5 same problem as above
# says which two principles the vis breaks  = 4/4
# vis doesn't work and writeup says how     = 10/16
Having to guess the mark corresponding to the body part can make it impossible
to do the tasks, not just annoying; what if two parts share the same recovery time?
The pie chart is a completely straight-forward way to show fraction (not annoying)

# Style (including linting)                 = 10/10
# Other correctness                         = 0/0

Write-up and code graded by: Kindlmann

Numeric grade components are indicated as a fraction E/T, where E is what you
earned, and T is the points possible. The final sum (written and coding work)
at the top of the file is another fraction; the denominator does not determine
the contribution of this assignment to the final grade.  Reading question
answers were given out in class on May 1, and code examples where shared April
28 at https://piazza.com/class/jf9pbi0hf8i178?cid=264 . Explanatory notes for
deductions may be above.
